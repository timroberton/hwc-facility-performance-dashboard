        Welcome to the “HWC facility performance dashboard” by the India Primary
        Healthcare Support Initiative (IPSI) project.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        IPSI is currently working in five states in India – Bihar, Gujarat,
        Meghalaya, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh – per the suggestion from MoHFW,
        Government of India. One district has been selected in each of these
        states in consultation with the respective state governments. We are
        collaborating with the leading academic organizations and implementation
        agencies in the respective states for demonstration work at the
        district. The aim of this demonstration work is to provide technical
        support to the Government of India’s Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness
        Center (HWC) program to improve coverage and quality of health services
        through evidence-based health systems strengthening.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        As part of this support, a need was felt to develop a facility based
        (HWC) performance dashboard that would be helpful for the districts.
        This exercise has the broader objective of enhancing the use of data
        generated from routine data systems for improved program planning and
        management. Such a dashboard would enable district, block, and facility
        managers to:
      </p>
      <ol class="pb-4 list-decimal">
        <li class="list-inside indent-5">
          Monitor HWC performance indicators from across portals at one place.
        </li>
        <li class="list-inside indent-5">
          Compare HWC facility/block performance within districts and over time.
        </li>
        <li class="list-inside indent-5">
          Link facility level and catchment community performance indicators.
        </li>
        <li class="list-inside indent-5">
          Identify gaps in performance and areas for improvement.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="pb-6">
        In order to develop such a dashboard, a review of the literature was
        undertaken to understand different ways of facility performance
        measurement adopted in India and in other countries. Different data
        portals used by the districts were reviewed to select key indicators
        important for planning at district and facility level. This was a
        consultative exercise involving all stakeholders, such as the state
        partners and district health departments.

        of Public Health, was established in July 2020. Funded by the Bill &
        Melinda Gates Foundation, the initiative aims to support important
        government initiatives to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care
        (CPHC). The initiative is in partnership with the All India Institute of
        Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS-D), who are our national partner. IPSI
